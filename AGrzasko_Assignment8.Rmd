## Problem Set 1  
  
**Your colleague either commutes by train or by the bus. 20 days of the month, she takes the train and the remaining 10 days she takes the bus. If she takes the train, she reaches work on time with a probability of 0.9. If she takes the bus, she frequently gets stuck in traffic and reaches work on time with a probability of 0.5.  Given that she was on time today, what is the probability that she took the bus to work today?**  
  
This problem can be solved using Bayes' Formula:  
<br>  

$$\mathrm{P(bus|on\_time)=\frac { P(on\_ time|bus)P(bus) }{ P(on\_ time) } =\frac { P(on\_ time|bus)P(bus) }{ P(on\_ time|bus)P(bus)+P(on\_ time|train)P(train) }}$$  
$$\mathrm{=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{10}{30}}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{10}{30}+\frac{9}{10}\frac{20}{30}}}=\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{6}+\frac{3}{5}}=\frac{5}{23}$$  



```{r}

# probability of riding train
p_train <- 20/30

# probability of riding bus
p_bus <- 10/30

# probability of being on-time, given train
p_ontime_train <- 0.9

# probability of being on-time, given bus
p_ontime_bus <- 0.5

# find probability of bus, given one-tme;  solve using bayes' formula

p_bus_onetime <- p_ontime_bus * p_bus / (p_ontime_bus * p_bus + p_ontime_train * p_train)
p_bus_onetime 
  
```
  
## Problem Set 2  
  
**In the Grade Network that we looked at in the notes, what happens to the probability of Difficulty of Course when you present the evidence that the received recommendation letter was good?**

### Load Libraries  

Install and load the relevant packages below, as necessary:  

```{r}
# uncomment scripts below if packages not installed

# install.packages("gRain")
# source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
# biocLite("RBGL")

#load libraries
library(RBGL)
library(gRain) 

```
  
### Set Up Network  

Specify the network using the procedure outlined in the [gRain vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRain/vignettes/gRain-intro.pdf):  

```{r}
# set up conditional probabilities
d <- cptable(~difficulty, values = c(30,70), levels = c("no","yes"))
i <- cptable(~intelligence, values = c(80,20), levels = c("low","high"))
s.i <- cptable(~sat|intelligence,values=c(90,10,20,80),levels = c("low","high"))
g.di <- cptable(~grade|difficulty:intelligence,values=c(60,40,80,20,1,99,10,90), levels=c("low","high"))
l.g <- cptable(~letter|grade, values = c(90,10,5,95), levels = c("low","high"))

# compile list of conditional probabilities
plist <- compileCPT(list(d,i,s.i,g.di,l.g))
plist

# create network
net1 <- grain(plist)
```
  
### Check Data Entry

To verify that we entered our probabilities correctly, use the the scripts below. 

```{r,}
# check difficulty probabilities
plist$difficulty

# check intelligence probabilities
plist$intelligence

# check SAT score conditional probabilities 
plist$sat

# check grade conditional probabilities
plist$grade

# check rec letter conditional probabilities
plist$letter
```

### $\mathrm{P(Difficult|HighRec)}$  



```{r}
# set new network with evidence of positive rec letter
net12 <- setEvidence(net1, nodes="letter",states="high")

# for reference purposes, let's calculate the marginal probability of positive rec letter
pEvidence(net12)

# find P(difficult | good recommendation)
pdiff.hirec <- querygrain(net12, nodes="difficulty")
pdiff.hirec
```
  
Given the new information, the probability of a difficult course goes down vis-a-vis our initial probability for a difficult course:   

```{r}
# base rate probability of a difficult course
pdiff <- querygrain(net1, nodes=("difficulty"),type="marginal")
pdiff

# change in probability:  probability with evidence - initial probability
pdiff.hirec$difficulty["yes"] - pdiff$difficulty["yes"]
```

### $\mathrm{P(Difficult | HighRec \cap HighSAT )}$  
**In addition, now present the evidence that both SAT scores were good and the letter of recommendation was good, What is the probability of the Difficulty of Course now?**  

```{r}
#  set new network with evidence of both positive rec letter and high SAT score
net13 <- setEvidence(net1, nodes = c("letter","sat"), states=c("high","high"))

# find P(difficult | good rec and good sat)
pdiff.hirec_hisat <- querygrain(net13, nodes="difficulty")
pdiff.hirec_hisat
```  
  
Given this new information, we find the probability of a difficult course is now slightly lower than our initial probability:  
```{r}
# change in probability:  probability with evidence - initial probability 
pdiff.hirec_hisat$difficulty["yes"] - pdiff$difficulty["yes"]

```
However, this new probability reflects an improvement over the probability of difficulty given only a favorable recommendation letter:  
```{r}
# change in probability:  probability given hi rec and hi sat - probability  given hi rec
pdiff.hirec_hisat$difficulty["yes"] - pdiff.hirec$difficulty["yes"]

```
